    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>I am an exceptional ninja specialising in assassinations and covert operations. With over 15 years of experience and a complex mastery of all the skills required to execute covert missions, no mission is impossible. From birth i have been trained in the ninja arts and when I eventually left the Shimada clan I worked with the Overwatch organisation for a considerable amount of time, gaining lots of working experience under the duration. After the Overwatch organisation got shut down I am now in need of a new  employment and responsibilities to take on.</p>
